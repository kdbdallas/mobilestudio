# MobileStudio #

  * The Official SDK version of [MobileStudio](http://www.pixiotech.com/MobileStudio) is available on iTunes from [Pixio](http://www.pixiotech.com).
  * MobileStudio is a collection of file manipulation programs for the iPhone.  The collection will eventually include all of the programs needed to make the iPhone a usable computing platform on it's own.
  * Please note that the package download here with all MobileStudio programs is only updated when all member programs release a stable binary.  This means that individual programs in the MobileStudio may be more updated than those in the package.  See the individual program's page for the most updated version.
